The depot contains a number of implementations of algortihms in python.

These have not been tested for accuracy, but not for performance.

The following algorithms have been implemented:
    1) count_inversions_py
       Counts the number of inversions in a list
    2) merge_sort.py
       Sorts a list using the merge sort algoithm
    3) quick_sort.py
       Sorts a list using the quick sort algorithm. 
       Merge sort will usually run faster than quick sort, but the quick
       sort algorithm performs the sort in place, i.e., it doesn't require
       a sperate copy of the list.
    4) sort_utility.py
       Contains utility functions to help with testing.
       a) is_list_sorted(): Returns True if the list is sorted.
